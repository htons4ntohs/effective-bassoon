# chain + any real corpus in corpus/real/) past the REAL deployed defenses and
# print the measured matrix. Companion to run.sh, which runs the modeled ladder.
#
# Real defenses are gated on keys (in ../.env or .env, gitignored):
#   ALCHEMY_API_KEY                                            (hosted simulator, free/self-serve)
#   GO_PLUS_APP_KEY / GO_PLUS_APP_SECRET                       (hosted reputation)
#   TENDERLY_ACCESS_KEY / TENDERLY_ACCOUNT / TENDERLY_PROJECT  (hosted simulator; API now paid/gated)
# Rabby is a pure open-rules port and needs no key. Unconfigured defenses are
# skipped, not faked.
