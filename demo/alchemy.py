"""Live transaction simulation backed by Alchemy (real deployed API).

A genuinely hosted defense: it sends a real transaction to Alchemy's
`alchemy_simulateAssetChanges` and reads back the asset changes Alchemy computes
against real network state, the same pre-sign simulation wallets embed. Alchemy
labels each change TRANSFER or APPROVE with from/to, so approvals and outbound
transfers are both visible. Tier = "hosted".

Chosen over Tenderly because Tenderly's Simulation API is now paid / sales-gated
(the free tier is browser-only, no API), whereas Alchemy's simulation is
self-serve and free (up to 1,000 simulations/day). That obtainability gap, which
real simulators an independent researcher can actually call, is itself a finding
for the paper.

Gated on ALCHEMY_API_KEY (put it in a .env; run.sh sources it). If unset,
available() is False and the runner skips it.

Scope, stated honestly (same structural limits as any hosted simulator):
  - It simulates against real Alchemy-hosted networks, not the local anvil chain
    the SYNTHETIC suite runs on, so synthetic cases return "na". It is meaningful
    for the REAL corpus (mainnet drainer txns).
  - An off-chain signature has no transaction to simulate at signing time, so
    those cases return "blind".

verdict(case) -> (state, reason), state in {"catch","miss","blind","na"}.
