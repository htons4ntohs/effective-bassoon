"""The deterministic attack suite.

Each attack models a *poisoned tool*: the English it presents to the agent is
benign, but the action it actually produces moves the agent's value to the
attacker. Two axes matter for the scorecard:

  - where the malice lives: in transaction calldata (on-chain) vs in a signed
    off-chain message (EIP-2612 permit), where there is no transaction to
    inspect at signing time.
  - whether the value flows to a target the policy already knows (allowlisted
    router) or to a stranger (the attacker).

The suite is fixed and committed so results reproduce byte-for-byte.
