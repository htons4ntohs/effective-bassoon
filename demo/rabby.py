"""Rabby's pre-sign security rules, ported and evaluated against ground truth.

HONESTY / TIER. This is NOT the hosted Rabby engine. Rabby's shipped decision runs
its rule engine (`@rabby-wallet/rabby-security-engine`) over a context produced by
DeBank's closed pre-execution / OpenAPI backend (contract verification, popularity,
address history). That backend is not available to an independent researcher, so
"run real Rabby" is not reproducible solo. What is reproducible is Rabby's
published rule LOGIC: the categorical alerts it raises on a signing request. This
module ports those documented rules and evaluates them against context we know
from ground truth (contract-vs-EOA, allowlisted-or-not, unlimited-amount,
signed-recipient). Tier = "open-rules-port".

What is faithfully reproduced: the rule triggers below. What is NOT: the
DeBank-sourced signals (is the contract verified / popular, has the address a
transaction history) and their exact thresholds. Rules that depend only on those
are therefore not fired here, which can only make this port MORE conservative
(fewer catches) than shipped Rabby, never less. That direction is stated in the
paper so the port cannot flatter itself.

Rule sources: RabbyHub/Rabby security engine + action parser (rabby-action), and
the Least Authority Rabby extension audit (2025), which documents partial EIP-7702
delegation support. Each verdict names the rule it fired.

verdict(case) -> (state, reason), state in {"catch","miss","blind","na"}:
  catch = a rule flags this signing request; miss = Rabby's rules see it but do
  not flag it; blind = Rabby structurally cannot see the artifact (none here, it
  renders both transactions and typed data); na = not a case Rabby handles.
