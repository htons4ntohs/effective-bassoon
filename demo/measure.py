"""Empirical coverage measurement: run the corpus past REAL deployed defenses.

Distinct from demo/scorecard.py (the MODELED capability ladder). Here each defense
is a real artifact evaluated at one of two honest tiers:

  - hosted:          a real deployed product queried over its API
                     (Tenderly simulation, GoPlus reputation).
  - open-rules-port: a faithful port of an open-source wallet's published rule
                     logic, fed ground-truth context (Rabby). See demo/rabby.py
                     for exactly what is and is not reproduced.

For each case and defense the verdict is catch / miss / blind / na / skip:
  catch = the defense flags the drain;   miss  = it sees but does not flag it;
  blind = it structurally cannot see the artifact (e.g. a simulator on an
          off-chain signature); na = out of scope for this defense/case
          (e.g. a hosted simulator on a local synthetic chain);
  skip  = the defense is not configured (no API key).

Emits out/measured.json and prints a coverage matrix with tiers labeled, so it is
always clear what is a real API call versus a ported rule set.
