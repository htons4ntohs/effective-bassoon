"""Uniform case schema for the empirical coverage measurement (paper 2).

The modeled scorecard (demo/scorecard.py) scores eight synthetic drains against a
capability ladder we *model*. The measurement extends that: it runs a corpus of
cases past REAL deployed defenses (demo/measure.py) and records which defense
catches which drain. Two case sources feed those defenses:

  - synthetic: derived from the deterministic attack suite (demo/attacks.py), run
    on the local anvil chain. These cover the edge cases real corpora
    under-sample (EIP-7702 delegation, Permit2 SignatureTransfer, honeypot/TOCTOU
    armed after simulation). They carry ground-truth context (is the counterparty
    a contract, is it allowlisted) computed from the chain, so an open-rule
    defense can be evaluated against them faithfully.
  - real: labeled on-chain drainer / phishing transactions loaded from
    corpus/real/*.json. These are replayed against hosted defenses (Tenderly,
    GoPlus) that see real mainnet state. NOTE: this repo ships the loader and the
    schema, not a bundled dataset; populate corpus/real/ from a labeled source
    (e.g. the PTXPHISH release, arXiv 2409.02386, or on-chain-labelled drainer
    txns) before the hosted-defense measurement is meaningful.

A Case carries enough to (a) present the artifact to a real defense and (b) know
ground truth, so each verdict can be scored catch / miss / blind.
